# Barn Pals API

## Purpose

This is the main repo to interface with Barn Pals' data.

## Getting Started Locally

Ensure you have the correct [Node version](./package.json).

Now run `yarn` to install dependencies.

Be sure to create the file `src/env/dev.js` that looks similar to [`src/env/dev.example.js`](./src/env/dev.example.js).

Then run `yarn start` to start the dev server.

The server should now be running on [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).
